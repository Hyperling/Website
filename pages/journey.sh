					Headaches, depression, digestive issues, lack of energy, and eventually
					unprovoked anxiety/panic attacks. This was the norm for me for most of
					my life. I ate a standard diet including fast food with meat always 
					being the whether going out or cooking at home.
				</p>
				<p>
					Eventually I became lactose intolerant due to antibiotics but that was
					only a minor inconvenience, and did not always stop me from consuming
					things anyways. I had tried the pills which are supposed to help but
					didn't notice any difference. This didn't phase my diet though, just
					had to ask for "no cheese" and stop drinking milkshakes.
				</p>
				<p>
					What finally hit me hard enough to start changing things was the panic
					attacks and an itchy mole that had to be surgically removed. By this point
					in my early 20s I was already plenty skeptical of things like organized
					religion and businesses profitting off of people, but it started to occur
					to me that there were not many facts about health in my knowledge bank.
					What most people were doing and what I was doing is not working.
				</p>
				<p>
					When I looked in the mirror to see my eyes dilating frantically and body
					feeling shaky and nervous when simply resting or eating a meal I knew that
					something was wrong. Then it occurred to me: "Why would God or Evolution 
					ever produce a species that thinks of itself as so advanced, but has
					so many health issues that they consistently die prematurely or suffer
					chronically?" 
				</p>
				<p>
					This lead me into a more nature-based approach to my lifestyle. Obvious
					things such as soda and candy were elminated first. Next was fast food.
					By the end of it I had eliminated "food" such as meat as well since I
					admitted that if I was living in the wild, I wouldn't be able to kill
					a cow with my bare hands or teeth, much less chew on its raw carcass. 
				</p>
				<p>
					At this point my meals were mostly fruit and vegetables. I didn't really 
					know what I was doing though. I still allowed myself bread, so most meals
					were oatmeal or peanut butter sandwiches with either jelly or bananas. I 
					was feeling	better, but knew that bread didn't grow on trees so I needed 
					to keep going	further. This was around the time that a nasty looking and 
					extremely itchy mole cropped had to be cut out of the the back of my leg.
				</p>
				<p>
					My saving grace was quitting a restaurant job in order to seek a job
					related to my upcoming career field of Computer Science. This was the 
					summer of 2014 before my final year of school. I had figured out that my 
					hydration was trash and was now drinking at least a gallon of water a day.
					I didn't have luck finding an internship, but I had plenty of time to 
					research health, and ended up doing an apple fast.
				</p>
				<p>
					I gorged on apples. Multiple pounds a day for at least three days. I
					honestly did it not expecting it to work. Being able to live on apples
					seemed like a joke, but I was willing to try it as an experiment. To my
					surprise I started feeling better and better! By the end I had decided
					that there was power to this and needed to explore even more! 
				</p>
				<p>
					For the following three months I was a 100% raw fruitarian eating as many
					calories as I could. I followed the advice of many people, mostly vegan 
					athletes such	as Durianrider and Freelee, but also others like John Kohler
					and Dan "The Man" McDonald. Dan also provided lots of good advice on loving 
					oneself and improving mental, emotional, and spiritual life. I also made 
					sure what I was doing was backed by medical staff such as John McDougall.
				</p>
				<p>
					I still tell people this to this day: those three months in 2014 were the 
					best feeling of my life. My body felt light lightning. I had so much energy
					and felt like I could literally accomplish anything. I started riding a bike
					without having done it since I was a kid, and was able to ride to a town 
					dozens of miles away with no training or practice, and didn't even feel
					sore. My body was finally to the point that God or Evolution intended!!
				</p>
				<p>
					Acne, gone. Skin was glowing and I got many compliments. Suffering from 
					the heat and humidity of summer? Gone as well! My body was able to cool
					off so much faster without having cooked food stuck in digestion. There
					were so many weird things that people wouldn't think of being related to 
					diet and lifestyle.
				</p>
				<p>
					Speaking of lifestyle, that is something else I learned from listening to
					my new role models. "Sleep Water Sugar" as Durianrider used to say. The 
					PDF on my main Health section covers the 6 pillars that I found to be
					highly important. "CTFU" (Carb The Fuck Up) is first for a reason, in my
					experimentation it was the most important one. Water and sleep follow 
					because I found my body does not operate or digest well if those are 
					missing. Exercise is next because it can go longer without being kept up.
					The last two are more spiritual, and reuire the first four to be maintained
					in order for them to be beneficial, but once they are achieved then they
					can help keep the first four in check when they dwindle.
				</p>
				<p>
					There was a day where I wondered if I was now cured of something and could
					go back to foods from my old diet. So one night for dinner I ate with my 
					family and had some sort of pasta with meat. After eating I ran an errand, 
					and remember within less than a few minutes, after only getting to the 
					street after our home, I started nodding off at the wheel. What a quick
					indication that certain foods are a no-go!
				</p>
				<p>
					Why would I stop eating like this, you ask? This was a temporary situation.
					I was on summer break from school and was free from a job. When the fall
					semester started I needed a job again to pay for gas, books, etc. So I
					added in clean RawTil4 type foods like rice. For many years I ate like this
					and still felt great. No oil, which I still don't do to this day. Also no 
					seasoning, I firmly believe in only eating food that you like the taste 
					of alone and would be happy eating as a monomeal. This is one of many
					reasons I don't like seasonings and prefer not to use them.
				</p>
				<p>
					There are other things I was able to discover about my body as well, such
					as alliums causing headaches, body pain, nightmares, and with garlic it
					becomes full-on night terrors. These are an absolute no when I'm able 
					to dictate it. Nightshades have also been slowly phased out, avoiding
					all potato unless deep fried so that the poison is destroyed even things 
					like tomatoes and non-spicy peppers. These are less of an issue, but raw 
					and undercooked potatoes cause an obvious head and body tingle/ache, 
					eggplant digests terribly, and tomatoes cause bloat. In 2022 as an 
					experiment with my wife while she tried a low histamine experiment I 
					also found that tomatoes were the reason that my nose has been running 
					consistently for years! I had been blaming bad air, but just goes to 
					show that you can never stop learning!
