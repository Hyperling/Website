				<strong>General</strong>
				<p>
					My thoughts are my own. I do not subscribe to any external systems.
				</p>
				<p>
					I believe in:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Peace over War</li>
					<li>Love over Hate</li>
					<li>Happiness over Currency</li>
					<li>Free Time over Salaray</li>
					<li>People over Profit</li>
					<li>Freedom over Security</li>
					<li>Rules over Rulers</li>
					<li>Simplicity over Features</li>
					<li>Trust over Discipline</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					I prefer interacting with human beings and creatures of the Earth. 
					Electronics and artifical persons are of decreasing interest to me.
				</p>
				<strong>Politics</strong>
				<p>
					I would like to be left alone to be a morally responsible adult. I do 
					not choose a side in the divisive hobby known as politics. I follow 
					arbitrary and meaningless rules only to avoid being abused by a 
					fictitious entity called government. I refuse any rules which are 
					immoral such as requiring one to cause harm to another living being.
