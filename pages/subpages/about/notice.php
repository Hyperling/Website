				<strong>No Guarantee</strong>
				<p>
					Anything I say, do, or produce comes with no guarantee or warranty
					unless explicitly noted.
				</p>
				<strong>No Harm Principle</strong>
				<p>
					I have the potential to be wrong and strive to admit and correct
					my mistakes. It is never my goal to cause intentional harm.
				</p>
				<strong>Freedom of Choice</strong>
				<p>
					My time is my own and only I choose what to do with it. I am in
					the process of reclaiming any of it which I feel has been given
					away in error.
				</p>
				<strong>Freedom of Association</strong>
				<p>
					I may choose who and what I do my business with and hold the right
					to make different choices at any time, regardless of any parties
					outside the voluntary contract deciding whether it is permissable.
				</p>
				<strong>Legal Jurisdiction</strong>
				<p>
					I am in the process of learning any rules I have been mistakenly
					bound by. Any agreements which give away Natural Law rights will
					be considered under duress through confusion and complication.
