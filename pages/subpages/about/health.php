					I have not been sick since I cleaned up my lifestyle in 2014. 
					No colds, flus, fevers, etc. My suggestions for accomplishing this are simple. 
					Consistently eat enough clean food, drink enough clean water, get enough good sleep, and enjoy life.
					Unfortunately our society today has very different views on how to do these things.
					A full list of my protocol without getting too into the weeds can be found here:

					Other free sources of imformation I recommend would be

					>Dr John McDougall</a>, 
					<a href="https://www.pcrm.org/about-us/staff/neal-barnard-md-facc"

					>Dr Neal Barnard</a>, and
					<a href="https://www.dresselstyn.com/" 
						target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
					>Dr Caldwell Esselstyn</a>.
					All of them have plenty of videos and resources online, there is no need to buy their books unless you want to support them.
					They have been reversing sickness for decades and their plans follow a similar whole food carb-based lifestyle such as my own, with NO OIL!
