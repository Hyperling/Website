					I have not been sick since I cleaned up my lifestyle in 2014. No colds, 
					flus, fevers, etc. My suggestions for accomplishing this are simple. 
					Consistently: 
					<ul class="indent">
						<li>eat enough clean food,</li>
						<li>drink enough clean water,</li>
						<li>get enough good sleep, and</li>
						<li>enjoy a low-stress life.</li>
					</ul>
					Unfortunately our society today has many different views on how to 
					do these things, most of which I would say do not work. A full list of 
					my protocol without getting too into the weeds can be found here:

					>Dr Caldwell Esselstyn</a>.
					All of them have plenty of free videos and resources online, there is 
					no need to buy their books unless you want to support them.	They have 
					been reversing sickness for decades and their plans follow a similar 
					whole food carb-based lifestyle such as my own, with NO OIL!

					Even though I run the brand HyperVegan, I am like the doctors and do 
					not have a strict adherence to the cultism of "veganism". Yes, when I 
					waver from healthy eating I <b><i>always</i></b> keep my diet plant 
					based due to compassion, but I do not and <b><i>will never</i></b> 
					subscribe to an absolutist ideaology which divides people. Think of 
					people shaming others for stepping on ants, accidentally eating gelatin 
					or a certain food coloring, etc. I do what I can for the planet and its 
					beings but am also practical and stay friendly with carnists, just as 
					I am still friendly with statists. The banner at the top of the page 
					is not just for decoration, I truly believe in those values. ;)
