					Hi there! My name is Chad, I'm the primary content creator
					behind Hyperling and HyperVegan. Thank you for your interest!
				</p>
				<p>
					My hobbies go further than coding and video making. I'm big
					into health and believe it is humanity's most important asset. I
					was fortunate in my early 20's and was able to heal myself and
					lock in a great lifestyle after a life of chronic sickness. See
					more below in <a href="#health">My Health Protocol</a>.
					It also includes a link to my full history of changes.
				</p>
				<p>
					I'm also an avid gardener, focusing on the principles of
					nature-based permaculture in order to grow fruits and vegetables,
					like in a Food Forest system. This comes with other outdoor
					interests such as hiking, camping, backpacking, foraging, and
					traveling.
				</p>
				<p>
					I live within the boundaries known as the United States of
					America.	From birth to 2023 it was the subboundaries of Indiana,
					and since 2023 it is the subboundaries of Arizona. As of 2024 I
					am working to realize my goal to be a nomad.
