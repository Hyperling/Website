					Hi there! My name is Chad, I'm the primary content creator
					behind Hyperling and HyperVegan. Thank you for your interest!
				</p>
				<p>
					My mission in life is to help others and make the world a better
					place. I adhere to objective morality and strive to teach it to
					others in order to create a world based on Freedom. I'd also like
					to recreate a "Garden of Eden" on Earth. Imagine if everyone
					planted at least one fruit tree or had a small square foot
					garden. We would be in paradise!
				</p>
				<p>
					Coding and videos aren't my only hobbies, I'm also big into
					health. I see it as humanity's most important asset and take a
					nature-based approach. I was fortunate in my early 20's and
					learned to heal myself. After a childhood of chronic illness I
					was able to lock in a powerful lifestyle and have not been sick
					since! <a href="#health">My Health Protocol</a> contains more
					information on that.
				</p>
				<p>
					I'm also an avid gardener, focusing on the principles of
					nature-based permaculture in order to grow fruits and vegetables.
					Food forestry is one of my favorites! I have many other outdoor
					interests too such as hiking, camping, backpacking, foraging, and
					traveling.
				</p>
				<p>
					I live within the boundaries known as "United States of America".
					From birth to 2023 it was the subboundary "Indiana", and since
					2023 it is the subboundary "Arizona". As of 2024 I am working to
					realize my goal of being a nomad.
