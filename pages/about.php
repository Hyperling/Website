					Hi there! My name is Chad, I am the primary content creator behind the
					Hyperling and HyperVegan brands. Thank you for your interest!
				</p>
				<p>	
					My hobbies go further than just coding and video making. I am big into 
					health and believe it is humanity's most important asset. I was fortunate 
					to have time off school/work/hobbies in my early 20's and was able to 
					lock in a great lifestyle after a life of chronic sickness. See more 
					below in <a href="#health">My Health Protocol</a>. 
					It also includes a link to my full history of changes.
				</p>
				<p>	
					I am also an avid gardener, focusing on the principles of nature-based 
					permaculture in order to grow fruits and vegetables, like in a Food 
					Forest system. This comes with other outdoor interests such as hiking, 
					camping, backpacking, foraging, and traveling. 
				</p>
				<!--
				<p>
					Currently I reside in the US state of Indiana and am working to move 
					to the southwest, starting in Arizona. Colorado and Mexico will likely 
					be explored. New Mexico and other locations will be visited as well 
					but have not yet revealed areas which offer exactly what I'm looking 
					for.
				</p>
				--> 
				<p>	
					As of 2022 I reside in the US state of Indiana and am working to move
					to the southwest for the following reasons:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Dry Climate</li>
					<li>Mountains</li>
					<li>Lack of Bugs</li>
					<li>Permaculture Possibilities</li>
					<li>Native Cactus and/or Spruce</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					The search will begin in Arizona. Colorado and Mexico will likely
					be explored. New Mexico and other locations will be visited as well.
