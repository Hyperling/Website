# My Website

Custom website rather than using WordPress or anything else that handles the code for you.

Rather than using apache or nginx just using Node.js to serve an HTML API. Gives more control.

Use HTML and PHP files for the content because it sounds fun and I like challenges.

Basically a "page" is just a program that echo's HTML content for the API.

Will likely play with some pages being Bash and other fun things.

All content is formatted so that the page source is readible.

# How To Run

The install script is currently only set up for apt, and the package names only tested on Ubuntu. 

`git clone https://github.com/Hyperling/www www`
`cd www`
`./run.sh`

Then in a web browser, navigate to `your_machines_ip_address:8080`.
