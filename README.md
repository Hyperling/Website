# My Website
Custom website rather than using WordPress or anything else that handles the code for you.

Rather than using apache or nginx just using Node.js to serve an HTML API. Gives more control.

Use HTML and PHP files for the content because it sounds fun and I like challenges.

Basically a "page" is just a program that echo's HTML content for the API.

Will likely play with some pages being Bash and other fun things.
